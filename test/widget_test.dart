// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MyApp());

    // Since the app shows a loading screen initially, we need to pump and settle
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();

    // The app should show either login screen or project screen
    // We can check if the app builds without errors
